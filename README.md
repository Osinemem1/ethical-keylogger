# ‚å®Ô∏è Ethical Keylogger (Educational)

A Rust-based keylogger developed for **educational purposes only**. This project demonstrates low-level system input handling, file I/O operations, and ethical security research principles.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This tool is for educational and research purposes only.** It must only be used on devices you own and control. Unauthorized use on others' systems is illegal and unethical.

## üß† Learning Objectives

This project was built to understand:
- Rust's foreign function interface (FFI) and low-level system APIs
- Global input hooking and event handling
- File I/O operations with error handling
- Ethical security research principles
- Rust's ownership model in practical applications

## ‚ú® Features

- **‚å®Ô∏è Key Press Capture**: Logs all keyboard input with timestamps
- **‚è∞ Precision Timing**: Records events with millisecond precision
- **üìÅ Stealth Logging**: Saves logs to hidden file (`.keylog.txt`)
- **üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling**: Robust error management with Rust's Result type
- **üîß Cross-Platform Ready**: Designed with portability in mind

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
